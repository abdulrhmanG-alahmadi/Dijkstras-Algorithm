# Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm in Java

This repository contains an implementation of Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm in Java. The code reads a graph from an input file, processes it using both a priority queue and a min-heap implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm, and outputs the shortest paths from a given source vertex. It also compares the running times of both implementations, providing insights into their performance. The code is well-structured and includes helpful methods for printing the weight matrix, edges, and shortest paths.
